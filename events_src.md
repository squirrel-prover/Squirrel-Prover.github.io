This page contains teaching material from several past events.

## EJCP 2025 (Vannes, France)

The school featured a Squirrel tutorial, with lectures in the morning
and exercises in the afternoon. It targetted PhD students without a
background in security protocols, cryptography or proof assistants.
A quick introduction to these fields was given, after which the core
approach behind Squirrel was presented. The school does not cover
equivalence properties.

Slides: [part1](ejcp25_part1.pdf) and [part2](ejcp25_part2.pdf)

## Cyber 2022 (Nancy, France)

Slides are available [here](nancy22.pdf).

The school featured a Squirrel tutorial, consisting of a series of
exercises of increasing difficulty, covering:

* the basic logical constructs and tactics manipulating them,
* several cryptographic assumptions,
* accessibility properties (authentication, injective authentication),
* equivalence properties (unlinkability),
* stateful protocol, and
* protocol composition.

As support material to go through the exercises, we provide
syntax documentation [here](doc-nancy.html).
The full documentation can be found [here](https://squirrel-prover.github.io/documentation/).

The files of the tutorial are now part of the official Squirrel
distribution, under the `examples/tutorial/` directory.
They are also accessible directly below:

- [0-logic](files/0-logic.sp)
- [1-crypto-hash](files/1-crypto-hash.sp)
- [2-crypto-enc](files/2-crypto-enc.sp)
- [3-hash-lock-auth](files/3-hash-lock-auth.sp)
- [4-hash-lock-unlink](files/4-hash-lock-unlink.sp)
- [5-stateful](files/5-stateful.sp)
- [6-key-establishment](files/6-key-establishment.sp)

Those, again, are available on our online version [here](https://squirrel-prover.github.io/jsquirrel/)

## MOVEP 2022 (Aalborg, Denmark)

Slides are available [here](movep.pdf).

Examples used for the presentation are [here](examples.html).
